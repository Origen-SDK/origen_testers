    # Tester model to generate .atp patterns for the Teradyne J750 in HPT mode
    #
    # == Basic Usage
    #   $tester = J750_HPT.new
    #   $tester.cycle       # Generate a vector
    #
    # Many more methods exist to generate J750 specific micro-code, see J750
    # parent class definition for details.
    #
    # *Also note that this class inherits from the base Tester class and so all methods
    # described there are also available*

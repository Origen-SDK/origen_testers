      # Capture the pin data from a vector to the tester.
      #
      # This method uses the Digital Capture feature (Selective mode) of the V93000 to capture
      # the data from the given pins on the previous vector.
      # Note that is does not actually generate a new vector.
      #
      # Note also that any drive cycles on the target pins can also be captured, to avoid this
      # the wavetable should be set up like this to infer a 'D' (Don't Capture) on vectors where
      # the target pin is being used to drive data:
      #
      #   PINS nvm_fail
      #   0  d1:0  r1:D  0
      #   1  d1:1  r1:D  1
      #   2  r1:C  Capt
      #   3  r1:D  NoCapt
      #
      # Sometimes when generating vectors within a loop you may want to apply a capture
      # retrospectively to a previous vector, passing in an offset option will allow you
      # to do this.
      #
      # ==== Examples
      #   $tester.cycle                     # This is the vector you want to capture
      #   $tester.store :pin => pin(:fail)  # This applys the required opcode to the given pins
      #
      #   $tester.cycle                     # This one gets captured
      #   $tester.cycle
      #   $tester.cycle
      #   $tester.store(:pin => pin(:fail), :offset => -2) # Just realized I need to capture that earlier vector
      #
      #   # Capturing multiple pins:
      #   $tester.cycle
      #   $tester.store :pins => [pin(:fail), pin(:done)]
      #
      # Since the V93K store operates on a pin level (rather than vector level as on the J750)
      # equivalent functionality can also be achieved by setting the store attribute of the pin
      # itself prior to calling $tester.cycle.
      # However it is recommended to use the tester API to do the store if cross-compatiblity with
      # other platforms, such as the J750, is required.

      #
      # * :pin - The pin object to match on (*required*)
      # * :state - The pin state to match on, :low or :high (*required*)
      # * :check_for_fails (false) - Flushes the pipeline and checks for fails prior to the match (to allow binout of fails encountered before the match)

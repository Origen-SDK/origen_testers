#### STIL

Patterns can be generated into STIL cyclized vector format by creating an environment like this:

~~~ruby
# environment/stil.rb
OrigenTesters::STIL.new
~~~

All of the
[Common Pattern API](<%= path "guides/pattern/common" %>) should be supported in addition to
[custom waveform codes](<%= path "guides/pattern/v93k" %>) like the V93K.

If the timeset waveforms used by the pattern are
[fully defined within your Origen application](<%= path "guides/pattern/timing/#Defining_Timesets" %>)
then that information will also be represented within the generated STIL pattern.

Optionally the defined timing can be represented in equation form by setting up your environment as follows:

~~~ruby
OrigenTesters::STIL.new use_timing_equations: true
~~~

If your application is used to convert patterns from another format into STIL format you can add
 a callback function to config/application.rb to set appropriate period sizes as follows:
 
~~~ruby
def convert_command_set_period_in_ns(timeset_name)
  return 25 if timeset_name == "timeset0"
  return 30 if timeset_name == "timeset1"
  40
end
~~~

A pattern containing a `Pattern { }` block only - i.e. only vectors and without the `Signals { }`, 
`Timing { }` and other frontmatter blocks - can be generated by setting up your environment as follows:

~~~ruby
OrigenTesters::STIL.new pattern_only: true
~~~

An alias for this configuration is the `D10` tester environment setup:

~~~ruby
# environment/d10.rb
OrigenTesters::D10.new
~~~

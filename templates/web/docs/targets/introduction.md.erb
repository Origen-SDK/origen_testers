## Targets

--------------

### Introduction

Targets are used by to configure the environment
for a given silicon derivative. Among other things the target will define the tester
platform, the specific NVM module to be tested and what the host SoC is.

For more background on how targets fit into the wider Origen environment read:
[Getting Started with Origen  Part 2: Anatomy of an Origen Application](http://freeshare.freescale.net:2222/public/origen-cmty-svc/_layouts/listform.aspx?PageType=4&ListId={4AF58DCD-005B-45F3-B13B-C007B7AB8609}&ID=11)

#### Setting the Target

The default target for your workspace is set via the origen 'target' command, or 't' for
short.

~~~
    origen t <target name>
~~~

Running this command without a supplying a target name will show the current 
default target.    

Many origen commands also accept a '-t' option to temporarily change to a different
target, for example to switch targets temporarily to generate a given pattern you can do:

~~~
    origen g <pattern> -t <target name>
~~~

When generating production patterns or test programs it is recommended that you
use the device MOO number to specify the target. This will ensure that you pick
up the correct target that has been designated by the NVM team as suitable for
your device, for example:

~~~
    origen t 0M79X
~~~

#### Supported Targets    

A given <%= Origen.config.name %> release may have some restrictions on what targets can
be run, usually because it contains some features that have not been fully checked out on
or are not compatible with certain configurations.

Such occurences are rare though and such restrictions would normally be highlighted in the
release notes for a given tag.

The targets supported by the current environment can be viewed on the 
[Supported Targets](<%= path "/docs/targets/supported" %>) page.

#### Available Targets

All available targets are in the targets directory, they use the following naming
convention:

~~~
    <device name>_<revision>_<purpose>
~~~

Here are the common target types:

##### production

The production target should always be used when generating production intent patterns
or programs. Using a production target will cause Origen to run in production mode which
among other safegaurds will enforce that the workspace has no local modifications which
could change the intended output.

In the C90TFS environment the production target also acts as a top-level bill of materials and
instantiates the correct FMU, Analog, Core and Firmware versions for a given device. 

##### debug

The debug targets are intended to be used when developing or debugging, basically at any times
when you may legitimately have local modifications to the files in your workspace.
Most debug targets simply load the production target and then switch Origen to debug mode,
although it is possible that they may also apply some further configuration changes to the
environment.

##### bench

Similar to debug targets except that these ones switch the tester to something that
can drive a bench debug interface, usually a J-Link or BDM driver. Through the use of a bench
target it is possible to generate any test pattern as a series of bench debugger instructions
and which therefore allow it to be run on the bench.

##### simulation

Similar to debug targets except some configuration flags are set to generate the patterns
in a format that is more friendly to (TPC VT) simulation. For the TFS environment this typically
means that match loops will be replaced by static delays and external pattern subroutine calls
will be replaced by hardcoded values.
